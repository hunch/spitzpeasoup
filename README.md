SpitzpeaSoup
================================

This is a wrapper for [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) that reduces the DOM parsing time by limiting the sections of HTML that BeautifulSoup has to look at.  For simple selects, it can be up to 10x faster than BeautifulSoup.
